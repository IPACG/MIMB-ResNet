# Deep Learning Enhanced MUSIC for High-Precision Coal-Rock Interface Recognition
# Abstract
Reliable recognition for coal-rock interface is vital for intelligent mechanized mining, as it enables shearers to precisely track ultra-thin seams (≤0.8 m), improve resource recovery, and avoid rock cutting that accelerates equipment wear and contaminates coal. However, the effectiveness of air-coupled ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is severely compromised by signal attenuation, strong echo coherence, extremely low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and the limited number of snapshots, making accurate interface detection highly challenging. Traditional Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithms, even with decorrelation preprocessing, become ineffective under such conditions due to rank deficiency and subspace leakage. This paper proposes a MUSIC-Inspired Multi-Branch Residual Network (MIMB-ResNet) that tightly integrates physical priors with deep residual learning. A dual-channel Hermitian-preserving covariance presentation is constructed and supplied as the network input, after which a multi-branch divide-and-conquer residual architecture is designed to extract subspace features, while a binary cross-entropy–driven peak discrimination module emulates the peak-search mechanism of MUSIC within a data-driven framework. Extensive Monte Carlo experiments show that MIMB-ResNet significantly outperforms both classical MUSIC and DeepMUSIC, achieving near–Cramér–Rao-bound accuracy with only 100 snapshots at SNR≥10 dB. The method also retains strong stability under extremely low SNRs and ultra-thin seam conditions, highlighting its robustness for real-time coal–rock interface detection in practical mining environments.
